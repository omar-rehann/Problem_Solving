# JavaScript Coding Challenges

## Overview
Hello! I'm **Omar Rehan**, a Front-End web developer. This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from **Codewars**, **W3Resource**, and **LeetCode** using **JavaScript**. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of JavaScript, and develop my algorithmic thinking, with a focus on Front-End development concepts.

I'm currently tackling **6 kyu** challenges on Codewars, having progressed **7 kyu** from and **8 kyu**, and working towards mastering more advanced problems. I've also started solving challenges on **LeetCode** to prepare for technical interviews and improve my algorithmic skills. I follow a YouTube channel that explains Codewars solutions, which helps me understand problems deeply and learn efficient solution strategies.

## Goals
- Solve daily JavaScript challenges from Codewars, W3Resource, and LeetCode.
- Strengthen JavaScript skills, focusing on key Front-End development concepts (e.g., Arrays, Objects, DOM manipulation).
- Progress to higher levels on Codewars (6 kyu and beyond).
- Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures through LeetCode for interview preparation.
- Document solutions clearly to serve as a reference for myself and others.

## Repository Structure
- **📁 Codewars**: Solutions to Codewars challenges, organized by level (e.g., `8_kyu`, `7_kyu`, `6_kyu`).
- **📁 W3Resource**: Solutions to W3Resource exercises, categorized by topic (e.g., `Functions`, `Loops`, `Events`, `Dom`, `Regular Expersion`, `opp`....).
- **📁 LeetCode**: Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty (e.g., `Easy`).
- **📝 Each file includes**:
  - Link to the challenge.
  - Problem description.
  - JavaScript solution.
  - Brief explanation of the solution, highlighting key JavaScript concepts used.
  - Optional: "Lessons Learned" section to document insights gained from the challenge.

## Current Progress
### Codewars
- **Current Level**: 6 kyu
- **Current Points**: 500 Points
- **Progress**: Reached 6 kyu and completed several katas at this level
- **Next Goal**:Continue solving 6 kyu challenges to prepare for 5 kyu — moving to 5 kyu usually requires tackling more difficult katas (5–4 kyu) and earning around 700–900 points in total.

### LeetCode
- **Current Status**: Beginner, focusing on Easy problems to build algorithmic skills
- **Next Goal**: Solve at least 50 Easy problems and start tackling Medium problems

## Learning Resources
- **[W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/)**: JavaScript Exercises
- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)**: LeetCode Problems
- **YouTube Channel**: [100 Challenges for JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ81jSdoFKI&list=PL3iticg1TvA-jMsFwDgdb6Cy_L__qL56H)

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Focus Areas**: Problem-solving, performance optimization, and writing clean code
- **Front-End Applications**: Some solutions may involve concepts related to DOM manipulation or Web APIs when applicable
- **Testing**: Exploring unit testing with Jest for validating solutions (planned)

## How to Use
1. Navigate through the folders based on the platform (`Codewars`, `W3Resource`, or `LeetCode`).
2. Each file contains the problem description, JavaScript solution, and a brief explanation.
3. Feel free to use the solutions as a reference or to learn JavaScript concepts.
