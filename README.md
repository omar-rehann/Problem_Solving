# JavaScript Coding Challenges

## Overview
Hello! My Name Omar Rehan  I'm a Front-End web developer, and this repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from **Codewars** and **W3Resource** using **JavaScript**. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of JavaScript, and develop my algorithmic thinking with a focus on Front-End development concepts.

I'm currently tackling **8 kyu** challenges (the easiest level) on Codewars, aiming to reach **150 points** to advance to **7 kyu**. I also follow a YouTube channel that explains Codewars solutions, which helps me gain a deeper understanding of problems and efficient ways to solve them.

## Goals
- Complete daily JavaScript challenges from Codewars and W3Resource.
- Strengthen my JavaScript skills, focusing on concepts critical for Front-End development (e.g., Arrays, Objects, DOM manipulation, etc.).
- Progress to higher levels on Codewars (7 kyu and beyond).
- Document solutions clearly to serve as a reference for myself and others.

## Repository Structure
- üìÅ **Codewars**: Solutions to Codewars challenges, organized by level (e.g., 8 kyu, 7 kyu).
- üìÅ **W3Resource**: Solutions to W3Resource exercises, categorized by topic (e.g., Functions, Loops).
- üìù Each file includes:
  - Link to the challenge.
  - Problem description.
  - JavaScript solution.
  - Brief explanation of the solution, highlighting key JavaScript concepts used.

## Current Progress
- **Current Level**: 8 kyu on Codewars.
- **Current Points**: 100 Points.
- **Next Goal**: Reach 150 points to advance to 7 kyu.

## Learning Resources
- **W3Resource**: [JavaScript Exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/).
- **YouTube Channel**: [100 Challenges for JS].

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Focus Areas**: Problem-solving, performance optimization, and writing clean code.
- **Front-End Applications**: Some solutions may involve concepts related to DOM manipulation or Web APIs when applicable.

## How to Use
1. Navigate through the folders based on the platform (Codewars or W3Resource).
2. Each file contains the problem description, JavaScript solution, and a brief explanation.
3. Feel free to use the solutions as a reference or to learn JavaScript concepts.
