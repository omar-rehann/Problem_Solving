JavaScript Coding Challenges

Overview

Hello! My name is Omar Rehan, and I'm a Front-End web developer. This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges from Codewars, W3Resource, and LeetCode using JavaScript. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of JavaScript, and develop my algorithmic thinking with a focus on Front-End development concepts.

I'm currently tackling 7 kyu challenges on Codewars, having progressed from 8 kyu, and I'm working towards mastering more advanced problems. I've also started solving challenges on LeetCode to prepare for technical interviews and improve my algorithmic skills. I follow a YouTube channel that explains Codewars solutions, which helps me gain a deeper understanding of problems and efficient ways to solve them.

Goals





Complete daily JavaScript challenges from Codewars, W3Resource, and LeetCode.



Strengthen my JavaScript skills, focusing on concepts critical for Front-End development (e.g., Arrays, Objects, DOM manipulation, etc.).



Progress to higher levels on Codewars (6 kyu and beyond).



Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures through LeetCode for interview preparation.



Document solutions clearly to serve as a reference for myself and others.

Repository Structure

JavaScript solution.



Brief explanation of the solution, highlighting key JavaScript concepts used.



Optional: "Lessons Learned" section to document insights gained from the challenge.

Current Progress





Codewars:





Current Level: 7 kyu.



Current Points: 130 Points.



Next Goal: Reach 150 points to solidify my position in 7 kyu and aim for 6 kyu.



LeetCode:





Current Status: Beginner, focusing on Easy problems to build algorithmic skills.



Next Goal: Solve at least 50 Easy problems and start tackling Medium problems.

Learning Resources





W3Resource: JavaScript Exercises.



LeetCode: LeetCode Problems.



YouTube Channel: [100 Challenges for JS].

Tools & Technologies





Programming Language: JavaScript (ES6+).



Focus Areas: Problem-solving, performance optimization, and writing clean code.



Front-End Applications: Some solutions may involve concepts related to DOM manipulation or Web APIs when applicable.



Testing: Exploring unit testing with Jest for validating solutions (planned).

How to Use





Navigate through the folders based on the platform (Codewars, W3Resource, or LeetCode).



Each file contains the problem description, JavaScript solution, and a brief explanation.



Feel free to use the solutions as a reference or to learn JavaScript concepts.
